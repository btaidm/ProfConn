                <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website is a resource for Michigan Tech students who need to access the files on their Michigan Tech student accounts from their home computers. Originally started as a class project, the site is designed to provide easy instructions for students of any level of expertise. We walk you through installing and setting up the software that makes the connection. After you&rsquo;ve got it installed, it only takes a few minutes to re-connect each time, and we have instructions for that too.</span>

                <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructions on this site will set you up with a connection to Michigan Tech&rsquo;s Virtual Private Network (VPN) over the internet. Through that connection, you can get into your home drive, where Michigan Tech keeps all the files and data that you save on the lab computers. It&rsquo;s useful for when you can&rsquo;t get to a lab computer because of spring break or a huge blizzard, and still need access to some files you have on your Michigan Tech profile.</span>

                <span>VPN stands for &ldquo;Virtual Private Network&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the term for a bunch of computers that are connected to each other over the internet, but don&rsquo;t let just anybody in.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c1 c5">

            <p class="c1">
                <span>More specifically, a private network is any network of computers that isn&rsquo;t open to the public--like the Michigan Tech system that stores all the data on your profile. When another computer uses a public network like the internet to connect to a private network, that&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;virtual private network&rdquo;. You&rsquo;re technically connecting over a public network, but since you need a username and password it&rsquo;s actually a private network. The instructions on this site walk you through the steps needed to connect your home computer to Michigan Tech&rsquo;s system by linking you into Tech&rsquo;s VPN.</span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="c1">
                <span>One thing to note about VPN&rsquo;s is that the information passing between computers has to use the internet. The connection to your MTU profile is only as fast as your internet connection. If you&rsquo;re trying to access a lot of data at once (for example, movies or huge image files) with a slow internet connection, it could take a few minutes.</span>
